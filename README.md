OpenClassrooms Python Bootcamp Project #2

Books2Scrape

I created this ETL pipeline To simplify the processes and tools used to extract, transform, and load data. In this case we scraped information from [Books2Scrape](books.toscrape.com) and by doing this I was able to scrape all of the books from the website and categorize them in CSV files that should be easy navigate.

The project was built with Python using an IDE called PyCharm.
